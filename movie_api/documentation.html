    <h1>FLIX</h1>
    <h2>Intro</h2>
    <p>
        Objective
        To build the server­side component of a “movies” web application. The web application will
        provide users with access to information about different movies, directors, and genres. Users
        will be able to sign up, update their personal information, and create a list of their favorite
        movies.
        Context
        It’s no longer enough for a JavaScript developer to be skilled in frontend development alone. It’s
        become essential that you be able to interface with (as you did in Achievement 1) and even
        create your own APIs. For this reason, throughout this Achievement, you’ll create a REST API
        for an application called “myFlix” that interacts with a database that stores data about different
        movies. 
    </p>

                <p>
                  myFlix is the web application which provides users with access to information about different movies, directors, and genres. Users are able to sign up, update their personal information, and create a list of their favorite movies.
                  <br>
                  myFlix consists of well designed REST API and architected database built using JavaScript, Node.js, Express, and MongoDB.
                  <br>
                  The server­side of the myFlix application processes user requests & performs operations against the data stored in the database.
